This contains my attempts at building a website with the most modern tools available
Isomorphic React - Bootstrap - Express - webpack - babel

to run : 

1) clone repo

2) npm install

3) run "node index.js"

4) in another terminal (in the same dir) run : webpack --watch (this creates bundle.js which the website serves)

5) in chrome, hit http://localhost:4000
